Scripts that analyse Moscow zones  in terms of people behavior and infrastructure. For this project the data from data.mos.ru and datasets calculated by Locomizer company (https://locomizer.com/) were used.

The main idea is to explore how residents behavior match with infrastructure  without taking much effort. By now  ( 06.02 ) only shops data is employed for comparison. In future it wiil be extended by the data on other facilities like schools or cycling paths. 

All ideas about how to improve this code are welcome.
